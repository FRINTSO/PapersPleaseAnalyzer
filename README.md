# Papers Please Analyzer ðŸ“‘

An automated analyzer for the game Papers, Please that catches rule violations and helps you avoid fines.

## About The Project

Papers, Please starts simple, but the rules and documents you have to check quickly become complex. It's easy to miss a small detail, which can lead to hefty in-game penalties. This project, Papers Please Analyzer, was built to solve that problem.

It's a console application that acts as a real-time assistant, scanning the game window multiple times per second to analyze documents and applicant data. It builds a profile on each applicant as you scan their documents, comparing the information to the current day's rules. If a rule is broken or if information is conflicting, the analyzer will immediately flag it, ensuring you don't miss a thing.

## Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Scans the game window continuously to keep track of all on-screen documents
- **Applicant Profiling**: Builds a detailed profile for each applicant as you scan their passport and other documents
- **Dynamic Rule Checking**: Prompts you to scan the rulebook at the start of each day to understand the current rules
- **Violation Flagging**: Automatically flags any conflicting information or rule violations, helping you avoid mistakes and fines
- **Console-Based Interface**: Runs in a separate console window for easy use alongside the game
